This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: type mismatches in function arguments. The `bug.swift` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.swift` provides a corrected version with appropriate type checking and handling of potential errors. The error occurs when the function `calculateArea` expects a `Double` for its height parameter, but a `String` is provided.  This highlights the importance of careful type checking in Swift to prevent runtime failures.
